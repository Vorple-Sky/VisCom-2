<h3>Chapter 1:</h3>

<h4><i>THE YANKEE DOODLE GLORY</i></h4>
<hr>
<p>Like a great, shimmering silver horn the morning mist swung out of the valley and Tom Graves swung along with it, sitting his tough, sinewy, thirteen-hand pony as easily as a lifetime of it can teach a man, and lifting the mare gently with knee and soft word and knowing hand when ruts or slippery timber falls cleft the road or when it dipped too suddenly into rock- strewn levels.</p>
<p>Fourteen miles beyond, an hour and a half s ride if the pony was as keen as the man, was Woodf ell, a one- horse, one-man homestead of drab, slat-built house, splintering, zig-zag fence, rickety corral, and a brown, hopeless blotch of illy tilled fields. There he would stable his horse with &quot;Swede&quot; Johnson, the squatter, pay more or less gracefully that flaxen-haired individ ual s habitual overcharge for a meal consisting of bread mixed in the flour bag and baked in the frying- pan, inky, boiled coffee, stringy bacon that tasted of fish, and rice pudding remarkable for its shortcomings as to raisins, and resume his journey on foot into the Hoodoo mining district.</p>
<p>Tom Graves was easily moved to laughter. He would laugh, at other psople and at himself, with his mouth that was wide and generous, his flashing, even, white teeth, his square lighter s chin, his nose that, starting in a haughty Wellingtonian curve, finished disconcertingly with a humorous tilt to starboard. He would laugh with every inch of his muscular, well-knit body, with his very hair that was uncompromisingly bristly and as uncompromisingly red; and he laughed now as he said to himself that the district was rightly named.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Hoodoo!</strong> The evil, lumpish spirit of man s aspirations, man s hopes and faith !</p>

<p>Once that part of Idaho had been famed for its rich placer claims that had washed every day into the thou sands ; then a misleading and glittering outcropping of gold-studded quartz, and a mad wave of adventurers, Americans, Canadians, Englishmen, Scots, and Scan dinavians, surging in and making the gaunt hillsides ring with the staccato thud of pickaxe and the dull, minatory rumble of powder and dynamite. Finally disappointment, misgivings, an indiscriminate swal lowing of both capital and labor in one tremendous avalanche of failure . . . And the merry band of Ar gonauts, shaking off their dismay as a spaniel shakes off water and cocking their beavers at the face of mis fortune, had followed the gold lure into farther fields, the Kootenais this time.</p>
